 New Year celebrations, such as the  fireworks on Sydney Harbour , when they were held, were mostly considerably reduced due to restrictions introduced to prevent crowds gathering. Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane (and the Gold Coast), and Adelaide cancelled their official New Year's fireworks.  In Sydney, access to the city, and the CBD in particular, was restricted, foreshore access was not permitted. The 9 160 pm display was cancelled, the usually boat crowded harbour was largely empty, and the midnight fireworks were reduced to seven minutes. Those attending hospitality venues required a pass to access harbourside areas. At homes, only five visitors were allowed.  In regional South Australia firework displays were still held in  Victor Harbor ,  Port Lincoln  and  Murray Bridge . In Brisbane some hospitality venues hosted private fireworks, but they were paid, ticketed events.

Victorian Deputy Chief Health Officer Allan Cheng had raised the issue with the  Australian Health Protection Principal Committee . Dr Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist from the  University of Melbourne  said Australia needed to  close the border or strengthen it as much as we possibly can .

After the strain was found in quarantined travellers in  Melbourne , the  Victorian Government  said it was considering banning travellers from the UK. citation needed  That afternoon,  Prime Minister   Scott Morrison  posted on  Facebook  to announce that he would  convene a special meeting of  National Cabinet  on 8 January.

He had already received his first dose of COVID vaccine. 2 of his 7 housemates, both food delivery drivers, then tested positive. 112 113  While likely to have been infectious the guard visited several locations in the community, raising the possibility of another lockdown in Western Australia. 114  It is not known how the guard became infected, but he worked at the hotel on 24, 25 and 26 April, including on the same floor as two returned travellers who were COVID-19 positive. One result was that spectators were not allowed at the  Western AFL Derby  on 2 May at  Optus Stadium . Prior to the guards' infection, up to 45,000 people were to be allowed to attend.
