Brief Overview of the project

    This project aims to develop a system for:

    1. Extracting Covid-19 statistics and news data:
        i. Scrape data from Worldometer and Wikipedia websites, using PLY module in python.
        ii. Extract specific information like total cases, deaths, and news articles.
        iii. Store extracted data in organized text files.
    2. Answering user queries:
        i. Implement a menu-driven program for user interaction.
        ii. Allow users to ask various questions about Covid-19 data for different countries and time ranges.
        iii. Utilize MapReduce paradigm to process and retrieve data from text files.
    3. Comparing and analyzing data:
        i. Calculate statistics like percentage change and closest similar countries based on data points.
        
    This project offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing Covid-19 data and retrieving relevant information from various sources. 
    The user-friendly interface and modular design make it a valuable tool for understanding and staying informed about the pandemic.

INSTRUCTIONS
    1. Run the handler.py script using command 'python handler.py'
    2. If the project is run on Linux system then all the os.system() calls having 'python' must be changed to 'python3'
