 The New Zealand Government eliminated several of its COVID-19 emergency powers including its powers to implement lockdowns,  managed isolation and quarantine  (MIQ), border closures, vaccine passes and mandates. The Government however opted to retain the Act's provisions for seven-day isolation periods, mask use and border entry requirements until Parliament passed newer, general pandemic legislation. In addition, the Government revoked the Epidemic Notice, signalling a shift from emergency management to long-term management of COVID-19. New Zealand's COVID-19 Response Minister  Chris Hipkins  announced that the Government would hold a  royal commission  into its  response to the COVID-19 pandemic .
